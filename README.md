PRANA: A Pseudo-Value Regression Approach for Differential Network Analysis of Co-Expression Data <br />
Submitted to *Bioinformatics* for consideration.

### Usage
Please download all three R codes from this repository. **combinedCOPD_RelatedGenesOnly.RDS** contains clinical and expression data. The full data is available from the Gene Expression Database with accession number GSE158699 (

* **TotalConnectivity.R** is to calculate the total connectivity of each gene. 
* **EmpiricalBayes_Datta_2005.R** is to compute the adjusted p-values via empirical Bayes approach suggested by Datta, S. and Datta, S. (2005). Empirical Bayes screening of many p-values with applications to microarray studies. Bioinformatics, 21(9), 1987â€“1994. 
* **PRANA_main.R** is the primary source to analyze the expression data.
