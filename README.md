### Usage
Please download all three R codes in this repository. 

* TotalConnectivity.R is to calculate the total connectivity of each gene.
* EmpiricalBayes_Datta_2005.R is to compute the adjusted p-values via empirical Bayes approach suggested by Datta, S. and Datta, S. (2005). Empirical Bayes screening of many p-values with applications to microarray studies. Bioinformatics, 21(9), 1987â€“1994.
* PRANA_main.R is the primary source to analyze the expression data.
